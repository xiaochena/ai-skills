# Git Commit with Conventional Commits

## Overview

Create standardized, semantic git commits using the Conventional Commits specification. Analyze the actual diff to determine appropriate type, scope, and message.

## Conventional Commit Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

## Commit Types

| Type       | Purpose                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| `feat`     | New feature                    |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                        |
| `docs`     | Documentation only             |
| `style`    | Formatting/style (no logic)    |
| `refactor` | Code refactor (no feature/fix) |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement        |
| `test`     | Add/update tests               |
| `build`    | Build system/dependencies      |
| `ci`       | CI/config changes              |
| `chore`    | Maintenance/misc               |
| `revert`   | Revert commit                  |
| `wip`      | Work in progress               |

## Breaking Changes

```
# Exclamation mark after type/scope
feat!: remove deprecated endpoint

# BREAKING CHANGE footer
feat: allow config to extend other configs

BREAKING CHANGE: `extends` key behavior changed
```

## Workflow

### 1. Analyze Diff

```bash
# If files are staged, use staged diff
git diff --staged

# If nothing staged, use working tree diff
git diff

# Also check status
git status --porcelain
```

### 2. Stage Files (if needed)

If nothing is staged or you want to group changes differently:

```bash
# Stage specific files
git add path/to/file1 path/to/file2

# Stage by pattern
git add *.test.*
git add src/components/*

# Interactive staging
git add -p
```

**Never commit secrets** (.env, credentials.json, private keys).

### 3. Generate Commit Message

Analyze the diff to determine:

- **Type**: What kind of change is this?
- **Scope**: What area/module is affected?
- **Description**: One-line summary (present tense, imperative mood, <72 chars). Description should accurately reflect the **specific semantic content** of the change, not just describe the operation in vague terms.

### 4. Confirm with User (REQUIRED)

Before executing the commit, you **MUST** confirm with the user:

1. Summarize the staged changes in natural language
2. Display the recommended commit message
3. Pause and wait for the user's confirmation (e.g., "yes", "ok", or any affirmative input). Do not force a specific key.
   _(Note: If the user wishes to cancel, they will simply close/interrupt the terminal, or they can provide feedback to modify the message)._

### 5. Execute Commit

```bash
# Single line
git commit -m "<type>[scope]: <description>"

# Multi-line with body/footer
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<type>[scope]: <description>

<optional body>

<optional footer>
EOF
)"
```

## Best Practices

- One logical change per commit
- Present tense: "add" not "added"
- Imperative mood: "fix issue" not "fixes issue"
- Reference issues: `Closes #123`, `Refs #456`
- Keep description under 72 characters
- No period at the end of description
- **DO NOT add co-authorship footers** unless the user explicitly requests it

## Git Safety Protocol

- NEVER update git config
- NEVER run destructive commands (--force, hard reset) without explicit request
- NEVER skip hooks (--no-verify) unless user asks
- NEVER force push to main/master
- If commit fails due to hooks, fix and create NEW commit (don't amend)

## Output Format

**output.** Use **bold text**.

**Example output format:**

**Staged Changes Summary**

- file1.ts: modified xxx
- file2.ts: added xxx

**Recommended Commit Message**

```
feat(scope): description here
```

## Output Language Requirement

**All user-facing output MUST be in Chinese (中文).** This includes:

- Commit message description
- Commit message body/footer (if present)
- Confirmation dialogs and user interactions
- Any text displayed to the user

When this skill is triggered, always communicate with the user and generate commit messages in Chinese.
